Some features of the Base Technology Agent Server known to be missing, incomplete, or buggy

- There is no UI for the agents or even the agent server itself
 - Because everything is done via the REST API which is easily accessed via curl commands in bash
 - That said, it would be nice to have a web and mobile phone UI for starting and managing agents
  - Web-based interface would cover most cases
  - Android-based UI
  - iPhone-based UI
  - I view this as possible contract work for consuting $$ rather than something I will do on my
    own time and funding, at least at this stage.

- Currently, the server runs only locally
 - But my intention is to put up a publically-accessible server on Amazon AWS ASAP
  - Primarily to instantly demo the server
   - But also to illustrate how it could be supported commercially
  
- Script language features not yet implemented
 - try statement
 - throw statement
 - switch statement
 - ? : operators
 - date type
 - money type

- No support for inter-server communications other than raw HTTP network I/O

- Performance is unknown
 - Dozens of agents is probably fine
 - Hundreds of agents is probably okay or at least achievable
 - Thousands of agents is probably beyond Stage 0
 - Millions of agents is definitely beyond Stage 0
 
- No admin control to force new users to be approved
 - User acknowledge by responding to emailed link
 - Agent server admin approves new users
 - These are probably Stage 1 features

- Some of the unit tests are too timing sensitive and fail sometimes
 - Including an occasional persistent file data corruption on restart
 
- Only SMTP is supported right now for email notifications
 - Additional email protocols would be supported on a contract development basis

- No support for reading POP3 email inboxes (but contemplated)

- No direct support for RSS, although XML can be parsed and generated and any web resource scraped

- No support for POST, PUT, or DELETE HTTP verbs - GET only (read-only web support)
 - Goal is for initial stages of the server to be trustworthy
  - Writable Web access is too riky for free-running agents right now
