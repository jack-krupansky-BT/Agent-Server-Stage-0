Script Syntax for the Base Technology Software Agent Server

Java control statements not currently implemented:

  - try/catch/throw
  - switch/case

Java statements implemented:

  - expression;
  - assignment;
  - variable declaration;
  - { statement ... }
  - if (expression) statement1 [else statement2]
  - while (expression) statement
  - do statement while (expression);
  - for (initializer; test; increment) statement
  - continue;
  - break;
  - return expression;

The overall syntax for a script is a block body, which is a sequence of statements and declarations
without the enclosing braces.

In addition, user-defined functions can be declared as scripts. In this case the syntax is quite
similar to a Java function definition:

  - return-type function-name ( type parameter-name, ... ) { block-body }

Java-style comments can be used freely in scripts, both // and /* */.
