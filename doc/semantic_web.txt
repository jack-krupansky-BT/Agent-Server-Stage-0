Software Agent Server Support for the Semantic Web, RDF, and Linked Open Data

There is no direct support for the Semantic Web or RDF in the software agent server at this time,
although raw XML can be processed, so RDF/XML support can be supported to a limited degree. That
said, the software agent server was designed from the start with an intent to eventually support
the Semantic Web and RDF.

Rather than simply support RDF at a low level, the intent is to come up with a rich higher level
model of RDF graph processing.

The various forms of RDF that will eventually be supported would include:

  - RDF/XML
  - N3
  - Turtle
  - NTriples
  - SPARQL queries
  - Comparing, merging, and factoring of graphs
  - Triplestore and quadstore
  - Sharing graphs between agents for efficiency
  - Caching of graphs

Graphs would probably be publicly accessible directly through the REST API, so the agent server
would effectively be a triplestore itself, and internally would be structured as such.

Additional capabilities TBD.

Actually, we are seeking feedback from advanced technology adopters on which Semantic Web/RDF
features they would like to see in an early release. From that feedback we will synthesize and
implement the high level model.
