Script Functions for the Base Technology Software Agent Server

Unlike Java, the agent server supports both object-oriented methods and non-object functions.

Non-object functions accept arguments of any type, although specific functions may require specific
paramters to be of a specific type.

The "number" pseudo-type accepts either integer or float values.

Note that "int"/"integer" is implemented as Java "long", and "float" is implemented as Java "double".

------

number avg(number arg1, ...)

  - Computes the average for a list of numbers, which may be any combination of integer and float

int centuries(number n)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" centuries
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value
  
int days(number arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" days
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value

int decades(number arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" decades
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value

Object eval(string expression)

  - Parse and evaluate an expression and return its value

void exit()

  - Terminate the agent instance ASAP
    - Script execution continues
    - Instance will be shut down gracefully as soon as script returns
      
int hours(number arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" hours
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value

int max(number arg1, ...)

  - Returns the largest value from a list of values
  
int minutes(number arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" minutes
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value

int min(number arg1, ...)

  - Returns the smallest value of from a list of values

int months(number arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" months
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value

int ms(number arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" milliseconds
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value
  - This function is more for documentation and clarity of intent in expressions

void notify(string notificationName)

  - Manually initiate a user notification
  
int now()

  - Returns the current data and time in milliseconds

float pi()

  - Returns the value of pi.
    - Based on Java Math.PI, which is approximately 15 decimal digits of precision

object runScript(string expression)

  - Parse and execute a script (code as s string) and return its return value
  
int seconds(int arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" seconds
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value
  
void sleep(int numMilliseconds)

  - Suspend script execution for specified number of milliseconds
  - Same as the "wait" function

float sqrt(number arg1)

  - Returns the square root of a number

number sum(number arg1, ...)

  - Returns the sum of a list of numbers
  
int weeks(int arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" weeks
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value

void wait(int numMilliseconds)

  - Suspend script execution for specified number of milliseconds
  - Same as the "sleep" function
  
int years(int arg1)

  - Returns a time value representing the number of milliseconds in "n" years
    - arg1 may be a float with a fractional value
