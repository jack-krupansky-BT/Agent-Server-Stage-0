Data Types for the Base Technology Software Agent Server

The data types supported by the Base Technology Software Agent Server are based on the Java data
types, but with some additions and omissions.

The basic types are:

  - boolean
  - integer
  - float
  - string
  - list
  - map
  - web

The "integer" type is equivalent to Java "long". The various Java variations for integer are
supported, but are all mapped to "integer":

  - byte
  - short
  - int
  - long

  The "float" type is equivalent to Java "double". Java "double" is supported, but simply mapped to
  "float".
