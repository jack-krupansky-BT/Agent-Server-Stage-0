1. Download the zip file from github:

   https://github.com/jack-krupansky-BT/Agent-Server-Stage-0/blob/master/dist/AgentServer-0.1.zip

2. Unzip to a directory of your choice

3. Edit agentserver.properties to change or fill in any blank values that you wish to set 

For the most part you can skip this step unless you want agents to be able to send email notifications.

4. Run the agent server

ant test-zip
(If you have cloned the source code from github.)

or

java -jar AgentServer-0.1.jar

or to put the server in the background:

java -jar AgentServer-0.1.jar &

The server will remain running until it is shut down.

If you use the java command without the & you will need to open a new command window to communicate
with the server.

5. Ping the agent server to see that it is running

curl http://localhost:8980/API/v0.1/status

{
    "status": "running",
    "since": "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 18:56:13 -0400",
    "num_registered_users": 0,
    "num_active_users": 0,
    "num_registered_agents": 0,
    "num_active_agents": 0
}

6. Check the "About" info for the server

curl http://localhost:8980/API/v0.1/about

{
    "name": "YourAgentServer",
    "software": "s0",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "Your Agent Server",
    "website": "http://your-website.com",
    "contact": "jack@basetechnology.com"
}

7. Check the "Config" settings for the server

curl http://localhost:8980/API/v0.1/config

{
    "name": "YourAgentServer",
    "description": "Your Agent Server",
    "software": "s0",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "website": "http://your-website.com",
    "admin_approve_user_create": "false",
    "mail_confirm_user_create": "false",
    "contact": "jack@basetechnology.com",
    "user_agent_name": "AgentServer",
    "default_web_page_refresh_interval": "60000",
    "minimum_web_page_refresh_interval": "60000",
    "minimum_web_site_access_interval": "60000",
    "minimum_web_access_interval": "100",
    "execution_limit_level_1": "10",
    "execution_limit_level_2": "100",
    "execution_limit_level_3": "1000",
    "execution_limit_level_4": "10000",
    "execution_limit_default_level": "2",
    "max_users": "100",
    "max_instances": "1000",
    "implicitly_deny_web_access": "false",
    "trigger_interval": "50",
    "reporting_interval": "200",
    "mail_access_enabled": "true",
    "minimum_mail_access_interval": "2000",
    "minimum_host_mail_access_interval": "2000",
    "minimum_address_mail_access_interval": "10000"
}

8. Work through the Intro

The agent server now appears to be up and running, so now you can proceed to actually create and work
with some agents. It is time to jump to intro.txt


99. Shut the server down

Once you are done using the server you can either simply leave it running, which is how it supposed
to operate in "production", or go ahead and shut the server down:

curl -X put http://localhost:8980/API/v0.1/shutdown?password=your-admin-password

Or, just use the "ant stop" target if you have the source from github.

TBD: Using github.
