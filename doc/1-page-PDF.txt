Software agents are a hybrid computing metaphor combining the power and flexibility or a network
of processes and web resources.

Agent server infrastructure factors out all of the bookkeeping and housekeeping and resource management
needed to support asynchronous, interdependent distributed processing computing elements.

Agents are a fundamental component of distributed processing.

Even the most complex computations can be decomposed into a computing graph of elementary computing
components.

Agents provide the power and flexibility of asynchronous networked processes without any of the tedious
and error prone bookkeeping associated with traditional approaches to network computing.

The power of agents comes from their simple but powerful internal structure combined with the automated
interconnection of a graph of agents.

Three goals of agents

1. Simplify basic computation
2. Enable distributed computation
3. Support long-lived, goal-oriented computing

Agent computing is not dependent on direct association with any client device or server. Although
agents can communicate with and synch up with any client device or server, agents have a computing
life cycle of their own.
