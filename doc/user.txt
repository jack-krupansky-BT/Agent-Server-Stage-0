User Support for the Base Technology Software Agent Server

Every agent is owned by a user. A user creates an agent definition, instantiates it, manages it,
monitors it, utilizes its output, and may eventually delete the agent instance and even its
definition.

A user has a name, ID, and password, plus other optional attributes.

The user ID is incorporated in all URLs that refer to agents that the user is working with.

The password is what assures that only the user themselves can access their agents.

Here is the complete list of user attributes that can be given when creating or updating a user
via the REST API using JSON:

- "id" - User ID (letters, digits, underscore, dash, dot, at-sign - can even be an email address)
- "password" - the user's password
- "password_hint" - free-form text to aid the user in password recall; not currently implemented 
- "full_name" - the user's full, legal name
- "display_name" - the user's name as it is to be displayed
- "nick_name" - short-form name for the user
- "organization" - the user's company, organization, etc.
- "bio" - free-form text bio description for the user
- "interests" - free-form test describing the interests of the user
- "incognito" - boolean which is true if the user does not want to be displayed in the list of
                active users in the REST API
- "email" - email address of the user, for notifications
- "comment" - free-form text for user to annotate status of the user ID
- "approved" - boolean which is true if a new user is approved for activity;
               currently this is always true, but the intent is to have an administrative mode
               where new users can create new user IDs, but they will not be activated until the
- "enabled" - boolean which is false if a user is essentially locked out from any activity
- "new_activity_enabled" - boolean which is false if a user is not permitted to engage in new
                           activity, such as defining new agent definitions and instantiating agents,
                           but is permitted to update and monitor existing agents
