The term "agent" has been tossed around and abused in so many contexts in recent decades that it
almost ceases to have a clear meaning. There are "system agents", "intelligent agents", "dumb agents",
"bidding agents", "recommendation agents", etc., in addition to other, more traditional concepts that
have agent-like qualities, such as email alerts and database triggers.

What are agents
- small programs optimized for distributed operation in the web
 - data-driven
  - change-driven
   - quiet and idle henever data is not changing

- closest analogy
 - database triggers
  - But not limited to a local database
 - alerts
  - But can trigger off of any data change, not simply the data for a particular vendor's proprietary system

- Define/declare the conditions upon which agents will take action
 - Timers at the low level
 - Data dependencies at the higher levels

- Composition: Agents can depend on the output of other agents
 - Dependency graph
 - Agents sit back and wait; no need to manually and explicitly check for whether data changed

- Very long-life execution
 - "Fire and forget"
 - Agents contunue on their "mission" without any direct human supervision
  - Yes, the user can periodically check in to monitor progress

Goals:
 - Very safe
 - Very reliable
 - Very secure
 - Very simple, easy to develop, maintain, and understand
 - Very scalable
 - Very distributable
 - Focused on the web the way a traditional app focuses on the local/LAN file system or databases
